# oyster-game
This is a game created for educational science communication purposes. It is a simple model population simulation of two fictional oyster populations in coastal Rhode Island. Each have different evolutionary histories and hence different responses to environmental changes. This game prompts the user for salinity, temperature, and pH values to determine the population size of the 2 populations over time.
